UCB Bootcamp 4/24/2023 This is the start of my coding career and i'm nervous. I'm anxious about failing because I have a lot on the line with my debt and my desire to get out of this house. It's going to be difficult and i'm going to sacrifice a lot, but I'm sure I got this. I have a dream to be free, this is my big opportunity.
